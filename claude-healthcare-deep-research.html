            <h2>Claude Brings Deep Research to Healthcare - And Your Personal Medical Records</h2>
            <p class="date">January 15, 2026</p>

            <p>Anthropic just launched Claude for Healthcare, and it's targeting two very different audiences: enterprise healthcare providers and regular people trying to navigate their own medical care.</p>

            <h3>Enterprise Impact</h3>

            <p>On the enterprise side, the impact is already measurable. Carta Healthcare reports reducing medical chart abstraction time by up to 66% and cutting costs by over 50%, while maintaining 98-99% accuracy. Even more striking: Anthropic demonstrated how Claude can compress what used to be days of work designing a Phase II clinical trial protocol into about an hour.</p>

            <h3>Consumer Access</h3>

            <p>But here's what caught my attention - the consumer angle. U.S. subscribers with Claude Pro or Max plans can now connect their lab results and health records through HealthEx, Function, and upcoming Apple Health and Android Health Connect integrations. Claude can summarize your medical history, explain test results in plain language, and help you prepare questions before appointments.</p>

            <p>This can also greatly help individuals that get stressed out or have a phobia of doctors or clinics, and the bulk of that stress can be taken away with this digital exchange of information.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

            <p>This matters because healthcare navigation is a nightmare for most people. Insurance paperwork, medical records across different systems, labs that assume you understand what "elevated ferritin" means - Claude is positioning itself as the orchestrator that ties it all together. Whether that works in practice remains to be seen, but the infrastructure just launched with HIPAA-ready security for enterprise customers.</p>

            <p>The question isn't whether AI will transform healthcare workflows. It's whether we're ready for patients to have an AI assistant that knows their complete medical history better than most doctors could in a 15-minute appointment.</p>
