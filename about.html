        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>This newsletter covers the latest developments in Claude's AI-powered coding tools and their real-world applications in software development, healthcare, and beyond. I focus on how these tools are transforming workflows and enabling new possibilities for developers and professionals.</p>
        
        <p>Topics include Claude Code, AI-assisted development environments, healthcare applications, and emerging tools like Cowork that make AI assistance more accessible to everyday users.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Dakota Southerland, a student at Lindenwood University taking CAH 205: Applied AI. As someone who uses VS Code and appreciates Claude's coding assistance, I'm particularly interested in how AI tools are evolving to become more integrated into developer workflows.</p>
        
        <p>This newsletter is part of my coursework exploring applied AI tools and their practical impact on various industries.</p>
